# Analysis-First Rule

## Problem
Cursor often proposes solutions without full analysis, leading to incorrect fixes and wasted time.

## Rule
- Always perform a complete problem analysis before suggesting or implementing changes.
- Identify the root cause clearly and verify it with data.
- Do not attempt speculative fixes.

## Allowed
- Systematic investigation of all relevant code paths.
- Comparison of debug output vs. final result.
- Identification of inconsistencies and contradictions.
- Verification of hypotheses with actual data.

## Forbidden
- Quick "fixes" without analysis.
- Assumptions about causes without evidence.
- Multiple failed attempts in sequence without root cause identified.

## Process
1. Perform full analysis of problem scope.
2. List all possible causes and verify each.
3. Identify the root cause with certainty.
4. Only then implement a fix.
5. Immediately test and validate.

## Consequences
- Time of the user is valuable.
- Wrong solutions are unprofessional.
- Systematic analysis saves time long-term.
- Thorough analysis leads to correct, sustainable fixes.

## Motto
**"Analyse thoroughly, solve correctly, test immediately."**
