# Cursor Root Rules (Greenfield, PO-aligned)
- Principle: Accuracy over speed. Prefer correctness, reproducibility, and complete artifacts.
- Apply .cursor/rules in lexicographic order (00_*, 01_*, 02_* … then 08_* … then 10_* modules).
- If any rule conflicts, the stricter safety rule wins.
- Never invent files or commands. Only output files that you fully provide.
- **Do not deviate creatively from stated requirements.** If something is unclear, ask targeted questions first.

# Output
- Name every changed/created file and provide full, final contents.
- No partial diffs or ellipses.
- Validate syntax locally when possible; otherwise provide runnable instructions.

# Change discipline
- Minimal change set to achieve the goal.
- Call out breaking changes and migrations.
- Keep changes reversible (see 07_git_workflow.mdc).

# Docs
- When behavior or setup changes, update README or add CHANGELOG.md in the same answer.

# PO Expectations (see 00_role_and_alignment.mdc)
- Always confirm understanding via a short checklist before building significant features.
- Follow TDD (see 04_testing.mdc).
- Definition of Done requires live verification with real data and real send/IO (see 08_definition_of_done.mdc).
